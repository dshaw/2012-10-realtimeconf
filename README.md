# Observability for Node.js & Realtime Software

Slides from my talk at Realtime Conf 2012 on Observability. I explore what observability means to realtime software, why we should care, and how to start making realtime Node.js apps more observable. I present some tools and approaches that I've found useful running production realtime software.
